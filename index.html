  <h1>Things that I have learned!</h1>

  <b>HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
  <p>
    HTML is makeup of text content, markup, references to other documents, and links to other pages.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Markup is made of tags. They look like less than/greater than symbols and surround the content. For every opening tag, there is a closing tag. Together they become an element. For bold, use the <b>(b)</b> tag. Italics are represented by the <em>(em)</em> tag.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you forget to close a tag, everything following the opening tag may receive the <em>italic</em> or <b>bold</b> command.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Computers are described as stupid because they can only address the instructions that programmers provide to it</b>. One small error can result in the message not being displayed properly. I made only half of this paragraph bold on purpose
  </p>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>

  <p>
    Tags can have multiple attributes. These are the property of an HTML element.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anchors are for making links and they are represented by (a)
Images are represented by (img). <a href="http://www.notcot.org/">This</a> is an example of a void tag which does not need a closing tag.
  </p>

<b>Inline vs Block elements</b>

  <p>
    HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
